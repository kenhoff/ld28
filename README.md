This is my entry for the 28th Ludum Dare.

For this Ludum Dare, my goals were: 

- make something interesting with a game engine that isn't Unity 
- not stress out a lot / have fun making a game 

...and I say that I've succeeded on both counts! I learned rudimentary Flixel about a week before the compo started, and I've taken care of myself and got enough sleep during the compo. 

I was really, really hoping that the theme would be "Death is Useful" - I've wanted to make a game around the corpse explosion mechanic for a while now. When I drew a (mostly) blank on "You Only Get One," I went with the "You Only Get One Button" idea, and figured I could work it into a game I was really excited about. 

Corpse Explosion is exactly what you think it is; kill bad guys, and blow up the bad guys' bodies to kill more bad guys. It's got a necromancer, magic missiles, and wonderful corpse-popping meat-squishing giblet-slapping sound effects. 

Thanks for playing!
